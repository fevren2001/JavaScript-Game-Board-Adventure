ðŸŽ® Game Board Adventure
This project is a web-based game featuring a 5x5 game board where players navigate and interact with various elements. The goal of the game is to find hidden clues and manage resources effectively.

Key Features:
Game Board:

A 5x5 board is displayed with randomly placed oases and a player figure starting in the center.
Players can move the figure to adjacent squares and reveal information about the current square.
Gameplay Mechanics:

Players set a name and primary water supply on the home screen.
Clues are hidden at the start and revealed as players interact with the board.
Players can perform three actions per turn and their water supply decreases with each turn.
The game includes mechanisms to replenish water and manage oases.
The game ends with a victory if all required parts are found or a game over if the water supply is depleted.
Additional Features:

A timer counts the elapsed time of the game.
Players can set a time limit to complete the game, which ends the game once the limit is reached.
The game board has a visually appealing design, enhancing the overall user experience.
Future Enhancements:
Multiplayer Mode: Features to support multiple players, including setting player numbers, positioning, and turn-based actions.
Animation and Saving: Additional enhancements for animated movement and game state saving using localStorage.
This project showcases my skills in game development, JavaScript, and UI design, providing a functional and engaging gaming experience.
